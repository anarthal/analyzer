Welcome to analyzer's documentation!
====================================

analyzer is a Python package to display data analysis results in different formats.
In short: you run your data analysis using your preferred Python tools, generate
a set of results (figures, tables...) and tell analyzer about them.
Analyzer will generate a neat, friendly web page with your results.

Analyzer is prepared to handle thousands of results. In analyzer, your results are
organized hierarchically, in a tree. This makes visualizing them easy, and prevents
you from beeing flooded in graphics and tables.

Analyzer can also generate Word documents with subsets of your results.
