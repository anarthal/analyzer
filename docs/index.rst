Welcome to prettyresults' documentation!
========================================

Prettyresults is a Python package to display data analysis results in different formats.
In short: you run your data analysis using your preferred Python tools, generate
a set of results (figures, tables...) and tell prettyresults about them.
Prettyresults will generate a neat, friendly web page with your results.

Prettyresults is prepared to handle thousands of results. In prettyresults, your results are
organized hierarchically, in a tree. This makes visualizing them easy, and prevents
you from beeing flooded in graphics and tables.

Prettyresults can also generate Word documents with subsets of your results.
